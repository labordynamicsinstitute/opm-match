Note 1:	Data Code may contain from 1 to 9 significant characters, depending on which data element code set is searched. SCT Table ID identifies the corresponding data element type:

AG – Agency with Subelement (See Note 3)   
EV – Educational Level        
GF – Occupational Category  
JA – CBSA (Core Based Statistical Area) (01/2005-present)
JZ – MSA (Metropolitan Statistical Area) (through 12/2004)                     
LA – Pay Plan
VK – Grade (see Note 5)                  	      
VM – Type of Appointment           
VX – Duty Station (See Note 4)        
WS - Gender
XB – Occupation   
XS – Sex

Note 2:	Most code sets (identified by SCT Table ID) use a Data Code validity date range to identify the time frame in which the code is/was valid for CPDF submissions. A value of “999999” in the Date Code in Use Until element indicates the code is currently valid. For a retrieved Data Code to be valid, the associated search date must be greater than or equal to an occurrence of Date Code in Use From and must be less than the corresponding occurrence of Date Code in Use Until.
		Translations use similar validity dates to identify the time period a particular translation is valid. The most recent translation is in Translation 1, the previous translation is in Translation 2, etc.
		The Date in use from/until values are zeros for these system-generated code sets that do not use Data Code validity date ranges:  GF, JA, JZ, VM.     

Note 3:	The “AG” group of codes includes both Agency and Subelement titles (i.e. Department of the Air Force, Air National Guard). Generally if the third and fourth position of the 4-character agency/subelement code are “00”, the code refers to an independent agency (OM00 = Office of Personnel Management). If those positions are spaces, the code refers to the main title of an agency or department that has additional subelements.
		Exception:  In mid-2011, the Department of Energy began using agency/subelement code DNFE for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and DN00 for all other Energy components.

Note 4:	Duty Station codes are composed of State code (pos 1-2), City code (pos 3-6), and County code (pos 7-9). Translations for States, Countries, and Territories will have zeros in positions 3-9 of the Duty Station code (“010000000” = Alabama, “RQ0000000” = Puerto Rico). Translations for Counties will have zeros in positions 3-6 (“010000019” = Cherokee County, Alabama, “480000113” is Dallas County, Texas). Translations for Cities in the U.S. will have non-zero values in all three components of the Duty Station code (“011730089” is Huntsville, Alabama).

Note 5:	Grade codes use two components to identify translations for employees with non-numeric grades in Pay Plans AL, AF, FA, FE, FP, GG, and TP. The first two positions of Data Code contain the pay plan code and positions 3-4 contain the Grade value as used in individual Status or Dynamics records. The following are example valid Grade Data Codes and translations: 
**00  	NOT APPLICABLE    
AFAA   	GRADE AA          
AFBB		GRADE BB          
GGSL 	SENIOR LEVEL                           
TPAA 	SUBSTITUTE TEACHERS - ELEM & SECONDARY 
TPBA		JROTC - ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY
